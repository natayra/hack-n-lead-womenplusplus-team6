## women++ challenge

### Context:

How do you measure impact? This is a problem many non-profits, especially non-profits in the social sphere, face every day. In an age where data-driven decisions are the gold standard for decision-making, how do you measure your success when financial returns do not necessarily factor into the equation? Non-profits face increasing pressure to demonstrate the impact they have in order to receive support from the government, sponsors, and the community at large. So how can this be done? That is the question you will seek to answer as part of the women++ challenge for Hack’n’Lead. 

### Challenge Description:

The aim of this challenge is for you to create a software solution to support non-profit organizations in defining and tracking their impact.
While your solution ideally is built in a way that allows sufficient customization to cater to a diverse range of organizations, we are conscious of the fact that this is an ambitious goal to begin with. Therefore, it may help you to narrow down your target audience both geographically as well as by topic. So you may for instance want to develop an impact tracker app for non-profits dedicated to increasing diversity in the Swiss tech industry.
